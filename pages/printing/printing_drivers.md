## What You'll Need

To install the printer drivers for the Petra printers, you'll need the following:
1. Your printer code (a 4-digit number from the Business Manager).
2. A computer connected to the Faculty wifi network.
3. The printer driver software should be in your Downloads folder. If it is not there, download it from [this link](https://downloads.canon.com/bicg2022/drivers/UFRII_V10.19.12_Mac.zip). Once it's downloaded, double-click the file to unzip it.

## Installing the Driver
1. Open the driver installation file. Then double-click the file named "UFRII_LT_LIPS_LX_Installer.pkg".
2. Follow the prompts, using the default options. Enter your computer password when prompted.
3. When the installation ends, click "Close".
4. You can right-click the downloaded driver installation file (ends with .dmg) and select "Move to Trash".
5. The driver has been installed to your computer. Now we need to add a printer and configure it's settings.
