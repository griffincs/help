The Admin printer has a paper folder/booklet maker that allows you to create small booklets for special programs or projects.

## Before Beginning
Before printing your booklet, first make sure your printer is configured correctly.
1. In the upper left-hand corner of your screen select ï£¿ > System Preferences > Printers & Scanners.
2. Click "Petra Admin Printer", then "Options & Supplies...", and finally "Options".
3. For the "Output Options:" dropdown menu, make sure "Paper Folding/Booklet Finisher A1" is selected. Click "OK."

## Printing in Black and White

To print a booklet, you'll need to configure the Printer settings correctly by following these steps:
1. Open the document you want to print as a booklet. Select File > Print or press CMD+P to open the printer dialog. (NOTE: If you are printing a Google Drive document, scroll to the bottom of the printer menu and select "More settings" > "Print using system dialog...")
2. Select the number of booklets you wish to print. If this is your first time following this tutorial, select "1" for now.
2. For "Paper Size:", select "Statement 5.50 by 8.50 inches".
3. In the dropdown menu, select "Finishing". In the "Print Style:" dropdown menu, select "Booklet Printing". For "Saddle Stitch Settings:", select "Fold + Saddle Stich". 
4. Click the "Finishing" dropdown again, and select "Paper Handling".
5. Check the "Scale to fit paper size" option. In the "Destination Paper Size:" dropdown, select "Statement".
6. Press "Print".

## Creating a Booklet Printing Preset
To avoid having to configure all these settings each time, I recommend creating a Booklet Printing preset. Here are the steps:
1. Follow the tutorial above to make all the necessary printer configurations.
2. In the "Presets:" dropdown at the top of the printing menu, select "Save Current Settings as Preset...". Then name your present "Booklet Printing" and click "OK".

Now, any time you need to print a booklet, you can select the "Booklet Printing" preset option and automatically configure the printer for this type of print job.
