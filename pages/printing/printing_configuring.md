## Configuring the Printer

The last step is to configure the printer so you can use all its features and print with your printer code.

1. Click to select the printer you want to configure from the Printers list. Then click "Options & Supplies..."
2. Click the "Utility" tab and "Open Printer Utility".
3. In the new menu that appears, click "Printer Information" to check your computer's connection to the printer. (Note: this only works if you are connected to the Faculty wifi network.) Close the printer information box that appears.
4. Check the box next to "Use Department ID Management" and enter your printer code into the "Department ID:" field. Leave the "PIN:" field empty. Click "Verify" to ensure your printer code is active. Close the box that appears when verification is complete.
5. Check the "Confirm Department ID/PIN When Printing" box. This allows you to enter a different printer code before printing, if necessary.
6. Click "Save Settings" and then close this menu.
7. **If you are configuring the Elementary Printer, stop here and print a test page from this printer. If you are configuring the Admin Printer, continue to the next steps.**
8. Click the "Options" tab.
9. In the dropdown menu for "Output Options:", select "Booklet Finisher J1".
10. In the dropdown menu for "External Puncher:", select "2/3 Holes".
11. Click "OK".
12. You have finished configuring the Admin Printer. This printer will only print correctly for you if you print in Black and White. Use the steps below to print in black and white and set up a printing preset to do this automatically.
