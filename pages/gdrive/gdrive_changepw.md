## Changing Password

It is a good idea to change your password periodically (you will be required to do so occasionally throughout each school year). Follow these steps to change your password.

(Note: These steps will not help you recover a forgotten password. Read [here if you have forgotten your password](gdrive/setup.html).)

## Steps to Change Password

1. Navigate to [myaccount.google.com](myaccount.google.com). You may need to login.
2. Click on the "Security" option in the left sidebar.
3. Under the "Signing in to Google" box, select "Password". For security purposes, you'll be asked to enter your current password again.
4. In the boxes, enter your New Password and enter it again to confirm it. Click "Change Password". Follow the prompts to complete this process.
