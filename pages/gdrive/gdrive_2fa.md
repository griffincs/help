## What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?

Two-factor authentication is a security feature that requires both a correct password and an arbitrary code in order to log in to your account. 2FA is required for all Petra faculty accounts. Follow the steps below to turn on 2FA.

## Turning on 2FA

1. Navigate to [myaccount.google.com](myaccount.google.com). You may need to login.
2. Click on the "Security" option in the left sidebar.
3. Under the "Signing in to Google" box, select "2-Step Verification". For security purposes, you'll be asked to enter your current password again.
4. Click "Get Started".
5. Choose how to receive the 2FA codes (a text message is sufficient and easiest). If you choose text message, enter your cell phone number. Click "Continue".
6. Click "Turn On". Enter the code sent to your cell phone.
7. Follow the final prompts to complete this process.
