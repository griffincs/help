## First Time Logging In

Petra uses managed GDrive accounts for faculty email, document creation and sharing, and contact management. After being hired, each faculty member receives an email with a link to initialize his/her GDrive account. This link expires after a short time.

## Forgot Password?

There is no way to recover a forgotten password on these Petra accounts. If you forgot your password and cannot login, please contact the Petra's IT services in person.
