## Capturing a Screen Recording

In the past, making a screen recording on a laptop required special software or a web app. On our Macbooks, this functionality is now built in.

To make a screen recording, follow these steps:

1. Press CMD + SHIFT + 5. Several buttons appear at the bottom of the screen.
2. Select the feature you want. These buttons are arranged into two sections. The left section allows you to make a screenshot of 1) the entire scree, 2) only the selected window, and 3) only a selected portion. The right section allows you to make a screen recording of 1) your entire screen or 2) a selected portion of your screen.

3. Choose the right-most icon, the one labeled Record Portion of Screen. Adjust the frame to include only what you want to record.
4. Click on the Options button to adjust the settings of your recording. You can set a timer to countdown before the recording begins, choose the location to save the recording, and more.
5. Click the Capture button to begin the screen recording.
6. Press the Stop button to finish the recording. After pressing Stop, a small icon appears in the bottom right corner of the screen for a few seconds. Click on this icon to open the recording file and adjust it or to save it in another location.
